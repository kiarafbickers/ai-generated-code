Homelessness is described as not having a permanent place or home to reside in. A homeless person’s home is therefore either in shelters or in the streets. There are several reasons why people become (or choose to be) homeless, and the accumulation of factors that lead to it vary for each individual. Homelessness does not care whether a person is young, has a family, is male or female, or are single adults. Some of the most prominent factors that lead to homelessness are as listed: personal choice, poverty, substance abuse, domestic violence, limited assistance services, unemployment, and limited support services. The effects of homelessness also vary and are felt differently among the homeless, communities, and business communities (Friedman and Danny pp. 19). Effects of being homeless are: personal, health, abuse, familial, and societal. Despite having plenty of reasons why people become homeless and why it has different effects on them, we will only touch upon a few common ones. Poverty is one of the biggest factors for causing homelessness. Poverty is when a person lacks the wealth or resources to maintain a proper standard of living. Occasionally, where someone has nothing to count on for income, they are forced to choose their priorities. Should they choose: transport, childcare, food, healthcare, or housing—which one should come first? According to a survey conducted in the US, many homeless people are usually employed; however, wages are not always enough to ensure their housing stability (Shinn and Marybeth pp.20-22). Many of these employed individuals were found not to have jobs that provide high job security and proper living wages. And of course, unemployment is also a major cause of people becoming homeless. When people lose their jobs or fail to find one within a reasonable amount of time, in many cases, they will not be able to rent or mortgage a place for living and will be forced to look for shelter elsewhere. In such cases, homelessness can be a friend staying at another friend’s place, or, as implied with homelessness, staying on the street. Domestic violence is another cause of homelessness. This issue involves occasions where children, women, and sometimes men, are physically, mentally, and/or emotionally abused. Families where the parents fight, on many occasions, results in their children becoming homeless (Friedman and Danny pp. 19). This violence may be due to several reasons, but still, results in homelessness. Another cause of homelessness is mental illness and/or substance abuse. According to statistics carried out in the US, it was found that this factor is found in 8% of all homeless cases. Youth and children around the age of 15 are most affected by substance abuse. Mental illness does not choose on age, but it may be due to biological factors or social factors (Shinn and Marybeth pp.20-22). In certain cases, family members will reject the substance abuser, while in other cases an abuser might run from their home and become voluntarily homeless. Being homeless, for some, is a choice. This circumstance is often rare, but should not be overlooked. This occurs dependent on an individual's reasons, which in plenty of cases is due to rural to urban migration, or someone being tired of the burden of life (Nooe., et al. pp. 105-120). Homelessness has many effects on communities, business communities, and the homeless themselves. Death is one of these effects. Homeless people die for various reasons: some may die from being abused, beaten, or murdered; some from malnutrition and a lack of food; and some may die from drug overdoses. Out of every four deaths of homeless individuals, one of them is murder. Also, a homeless person has a life expectancy of a reduced 20 years below the average of that country’s standard (Edidin., et al. pp. 354-367). Homeless children and adults are also at a greater risk of serious health problems. The homeless are always exposed to unsanitary living conditions and, on many occasions, eat unhealthy food. Common health problems among the homeless are leg ulcers, respiratory infections, tuberculosis, pneumonia, and HIV/AIDS—among others. Homeless children lack stability in education, which leads to adverse effects on their academic performance. These children may lack the proper conditions for studying. Children who are homeless also experience hunger, poor mental and physical health, and missed educational opportunities. Homelessness further leads to homelessnes in for children, and a high rate of insecurity in cities. Crime rate increases steadily with rising unemployment, which causes homelessness. Business communities start to make diminishing revenue in areas most affected by homelessness. Security in homeless affected areas is threatened—as businesses require customers, yet most of them are homeless and/or unemployed (Nooe., et al. pp. 105-120). Finally, homelessness can result in family breakdowns. In cases of domestic violence, families usually end up broken, making them live sad and unhappy lives. It is, therefore, advisable for nations to understand their populations, and the causes and effects of homelessness, to construct proper strategies for preventing it. Nooe, Roger M., and David A.
